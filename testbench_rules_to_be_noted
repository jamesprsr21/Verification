1. include "uvm_maros.svh"
  import uvm_pkg::*;
 inside the module top. Other wise it won't able to call run_test();

2. All the tb_components classes should be inside the top module only.
  there are many ways you can write, for eg.
  a. You can directly write tb_component classes inside the top module 
  b. You can write in separate files, and then include all the class files inside the module
  c. You can include all the class files in package,and then import the package inside the top module.

3. Write uvm_top.print_topology in test class(top hierarchy) in end_of_elaboration_phase.

4. Always make sure the tb class hierarchy is in proper sequence.
   like first write the lower level classes then to top level classes. eg driver,monitor -> then agent ->env -> then test
 Otherwise it will through an error: 
# Unrecognized declaration ‘class_name' could be an unsupported keyword, a spelling mistake or missing instance port list ‘()’ [SystemVerilog]. Geting this error
